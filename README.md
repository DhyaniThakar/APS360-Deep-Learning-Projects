# APS360-Deep-Learning-Projects

### These projects have been completed by Dhyani Thakar and are associated with the APS360 (Fundamentals of Deep Learning) course at the University of Toronto.

#### Project 4 Description
In this project, **Data Imputation using an Autoencoder**, the goal is to build and train a denoising autoencoder to impute missing values in the **Adult Data Set** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Rather than using the dataset for classification, the task focuses on predicting missing categorical or continuous features based on available data. Key concepts and tools include:

- **Data cleaning and preprocessing** for both continuous and categorical (one-hot) data.
- Implementing and training an **autoencoder** for data imputation.
- **Hyperparameter tuning** of the autoencoder.
- Comparing performance using **baseline models** to interpret results effectively.
